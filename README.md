# SQL Server Install Configuration
Generic configuration script applied post-installation of an SQL Server instance.

Change the variable values at the top of the script should suffice however it is suggested that the script is reviewed before applying to *any* environment.

Tested with Express, Developer, Standard and Enterprise Editions of SQL Server 2005, 2008, 2008 R2, 2014, and 2016 (32-bit and 64-bit installations).

NOTE: Has not been tested with any Cloud implementation yet, but any feedback would be appreciated.
